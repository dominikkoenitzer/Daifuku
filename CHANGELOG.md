# Changelog

## Unreleased

- A second zip for Windows on ARM, built and checked in every release.
- `{n}` works in a fleet's `directory` as it does in its `command`, so each
  agent can start in a folder of its own, such as its own git worktree.

## 0.1.1, 2026-09-30

- The daemon reloads the config by itself within two seconds of a save.
- When a monitor is plugged in, unplugged or changes resolution, open fleets
  move back into the grid of the monitor they belong on.
- `daifuku status` shows how long each agent has been in its state.
- The release checks wait for the windowless daemon before reading its
  version; the first 0.1.0 run failed there, the code was fine.

## 0.1.0, 2026-09-30

The first release.

- One hotkey opens a fleet of Windows Terminal windows in a grid on a chosen
  monitor, placed by their visible edge so the gaps are exact.
- Each terminal's border shows its agent's state: working, waiting for you,
  done or failed, each at its own width as well as in its own colour.
- Claude Code and Codex report through hooks that find their own terminal
  window; `daifuku install` adds them and keeps every hook already there.
- Ctrl+Alt+N jumps to the agent that has waited longest, Ctrl+Alt+Backspace
  puts every terminal back in its cell.
- A colour-blind palette, high contrast colours, a pulse that stops when
  Windows shows no animations, and an optional chime.
- `daifuku demo` opens six scripted agents to try it without a real one.
- The daemon runs elevated; its binaries, config and command pipe are locked
  to administrators.
